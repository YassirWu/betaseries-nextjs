# Simple NextJs/Semantic UI web application based on BetaSeries API.

This is just a simple project that allowed me to discover and learn new tools. I use this stack:
* ReactJs
* NextJs
* SWR
* Semantic UI
* Typescript
* Atomic Design

## Clone

Get the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YassirWu/betaseries-nextjs
```
And run the development server with NPM:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## About this repository

I will continue to update this project and to add new features. You can fork this project if you want to use it as a template, analyze the code or give me some advices (don't hesitate :D)

All the application's data comes from the [API Betaseries](https://www.betaseries.com/api/).
